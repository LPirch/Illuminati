# Illuminati

This repository contains the source code for the paper, `Illuminati: Towards Explaining Graph Neural Networks for Cybersecurity Analysis` by Haoyu He, Yuede Ji and H. Howie Huang ([EuroS&P 2022](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/EuroSP2022/)).

We provide the implementation of public datasets.

## Requirements

We use [Pytorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) for implementation. Please follow the instruction to install Pytorch Geometric.

## Datasets

The datasets can be loaded from Pytorch Geometric. The datasets we use in the paper are:

```
["BBBP", "Mutagenicity", "BA-2motifs"]
```
